# memex - Agent Instructions

## What this project is

`memex` is a CLI tool that organizes LLM-assisted development into a versioned DAG of conversation nodes. It is a **storage and navigation layer**.

## Development workflow

This project tracks its own development using `memex`. Follow this pattern for every feature or fix:

1. **Find a parent node** - Identify the most relevant resolved node to attach to before branching:
2. - `memex context` - get the a context payload for the active and root nodes.
   - `memex graph view` - see the full DAG; the deepest resolved leaf on the relevant branch is usually the right parent (marked `[*]` if it's the current active node)
   - `memex node list` - shows all nodes with IDs, statuses, git refs, and one-line goals; scan for the most recent resolved node whose scope contains yours
   - `memex search <keyword>` - full-text search across node summaries; use domain terms (e.g. `config`, `search`, `rename`) to surface the closest prior work
   - When work is genuinely new, attach to the current active node (`[*]` in graph view or `*` in node list)
   - Prefer the most specific ancestor: if a node for `feat/search` exists and you're extending search, use it rather than the root

2. **Branch** - `git checkout -b <type>/<name>` from `main`
3. **Node** - `memex node create --parent <parent-id> --goal "<placeholder goal>"` before writing any code. You'll fill in the real summary with `memex node edit` later.
4. **Implement** the feature
5. **Summarize** - `memex node edit` to write decisions, rejected approaches, and key artifacts. Do this yourself; do not add LLM API calls to automate it.
6. **Resolve** - `memex node resolve`
7. **Commit** source changes and the updated `.memex/` files together
8. **Push** and open a PR

## What to commit

Always commit `.memex/graph.json` and `.memex/nodes/` alongside source changes - the conversation history is part of the project record. Never commit `.memex/state.json`.

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.rs               - CLI entrypoint, clap derive command tree
  models.rs             - ConversationNode, NodeSummary, NodeStatus, Graph, State, Config
  store.rs              - GraphStore: all file I/O abstracted here
  editor.rs             - $EDITOR integration via temp TOML file
  git.rs                - git detection via subprocess (no libgit2)
  commands/
    init.rs             - memex init
    node.rs             - create, edit, show, list, resolve/abandon/reopen
    graph.rs            - ASCII tree view
    context.rs          - context payload generation (markdown/xml/plain)
    search.rs           - full-text search across node summaries
```

Key design decisions already made - don't revisit without good reason:
- One JSON file per node (`nodes/<uuid>.json`) for human-readable git diffs
- `graph.json` holds edges + root pointer; `state.json` (untracked) holds active node
- Git integration uses `git` subprocess, not libgit2, to keep the dependency footprint small
